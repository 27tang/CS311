\paragraph{Problem 1}
 A {\em Turing machine with left reset} is similar to an ordinary Turing machine, but the 
 transition function has the form
  \begin{displaymath}
    \delta : Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{R,RESET\}
  \end{displaymath}
If $\delta (q,a) = (r,b,RESET)$, when the machine is in state $q$ reading an $a$, the machine's 
head jumps to the left-hand end of the tape after it writes $b$ on the tape and enters state 
$r$. Note that these machines do not have the usual ability to move the head one symbol left. 
Show that Turing machines with left reset recognize the class of Turing-recognizable languages.

  (Hint: Much like previous problems in this class, you'll need to describe some general 
  construction that takes a Turing Machine-with-reset to an ordinary Turing Machine and visa-versa)

\paragraph{Problem 2}
Give the informal descriptions for Turing machines that decide the following languages
\begin{enumerate}[\indent a)]
    \item $\{w \;|\; w \text{ contains twice as many 0s as 1s }\}$
    
	$M = $ "On input string w:
	\begin{enumerate}[\indent 1.]
		\item Scan tape and mark the first unmarked $0$. If no unmarked $0$ is found, jump to step 4.
		\item Continue to the right and mark the next unmarked $0$, then return read-head to start of tape. If no unmarked $0$ is found, $reject$.
		\item Scan tape and mark the next unmarked $1$. If no unmarked $1$ is found, $reject$. Otherwise, go move read-head to start of tape, and go back to step 1.
		\item Scan the tape to look for unmarked $1$s. If there are any unmarked $1$s left, $reject$. If there are not any unmarked $1$s, $accept$."	
    \end{enumerate}


    \item $\{a+b=c \;|\; a,b,c \in \{0,1\}* \text{ and the binary numbers represented by $a$ 
    and $b$ sum to $c$} \}$
    
    \begin{enumerate}[\indent 1.]
		\item Scan tape to check if string is in the format: $\{0,1\}^* + \{0,1\}^* = \{0,1\}^* $. If it isn't, $reject$. Move read-head back to start of tape.
		\item Scan tape to check if all the $0$s and $1$s  before the $=$ symbol have been crossed off. If so, go to step 9. Scan right until either an $X$ ($X$ means crossed out symbol) or a $+$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol was a $0$, or no unmarked symbol was found, go to step 3. If the symbol was a $1$, go to step 4.
		
		
		\item Move past the $+$ sign and scan until either an $X$ or an $=$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol was a $0$ go to step 5. If the symbol was a $1$, go to step 6. If no unmarked symbol was found between the $+$ and the $=$ sign, go to step 5.
		\item Move past the $+$ sign and scan until either an $X$ or an $=$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol was a $0$ go to step 6. If the symbol was a $1$, go to step 7. If no unmarked symbol was found between the $+$ and the $=$ sign, go to step 6 .
		
		\item (case: $0 + 0 = 0$) Move past the $=$ sign and scan until either an $X$ or an $space$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol was a $0$, move read-head back to start of tape, and go to step 2. If the symbol was a $1$, or no unmarked symbol was found, $reject$.
		
		\item (case: $0 + 1 = 1$ or $1 + 0 = 1$) Move past the $=$ sign and scan until either an $X$ or a $space$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol at the read-head was a $1$, move read-head back to start of tape and go to step 2. If the symbol was a $0$, or no unmarked symbol was found, $reject$.
		
		\item (case: $1 + 1 = 10$) Move past the $=$ sign and scan until either an $X$ or a $space$ is found. Move left by one position. Cross off the symbol at the read-head. If the symbol at the read-head was a $0$, move to the left until arriving at the $+$ sign. If the symbol at the read-head was a $1$, or no unmarked symbol was found, $reject$.
		
		\item Scan to the left and find the first unmarked symbol. If the symbol is a $0$, write a $1$ in its place. If the symbol is a $1$, write a $0$ in its place, and repeat this step(step 8). If no unmarked symbol is found, shift the contents of the entire tape to the right by one position, and fill the vacant position at the start of the tape with $1$. Go to step 2.
		
		\item Scan right to check if all symbols after the $=$ have been crossed off. If they have, $accept$. Otherwise, $reject$."

\paragraph{Problem 3}
Show that the Turing-decidable languages are closed under
\begin{enumerate}[\indent a)]
    \item union: 
    
    Let $L$ be the union of two Turing-decidable languages, $L_1$ and $L_2$. A language is decidable if and only if some non-deterministic Turing machine decides it(Corollary 3.19). Therefore it follows that for languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, there exist Turing machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide them.

$L = L_1 \cup L_2$ is Turing-decidable if and only if there is some non-deterministic Turing machine that decides it. Any non-deterministic Turing machine is automatically a deterministic Turing machine. So, to show that the Turing-decidable languages are closed under union, we describe a Turing machine $M$ that decides $L$, where
$$L = \{w \;|\;  w \in L_1\cup L_2, M_1 \text{ and  $M_2$ decide $L_1$ and $L_2$}\}$$

$M = $ "On input string $w$: 
    \begin{enumerate}[\indent 1.]
    \item Run $M_1$ on $w$. If it accepts, $accept$.
    \item Run $M_2$ on $w$. If it accepts, $accept$.
    \item If both $M_1$ and $M_2$ halt and reject, $reject$."
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    Since $M$ will always halt -- end up in either an accept or reject state, $L$ is decidable.
    
    \item intersection: 
    
    Let $L$ be the intersection of two Turing-decidable languages, $L_1$ and $L_2$. A language is decidable if and only if some non-deterministic Turing machine decides it(Corollary 3.19). Therefore it follows that for languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, there exist Turing machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide them.

$L = L_1 \cup L_2$ is Turing-decidable if and only if there is some non-deterministic Turing machine that decides it. So, to show that the Turing-decidable languages are closed under intersection, we describe a Turing machine $M$ that decides $L$, where
$$L = \{w \;|\;  w \in L_1\cap L_2, M_1 \text{ and  $M_2$ decide $L_1$ and $L_2$}\}$$

$M = $ "On input string $w$: 
    \\1. Run $M_1$ on $w$. If it rejects, then reject.
    \\2. If $M_1$ accepts the input, run $M_2$ on $w$. If $M_2$ rejects, then reject.
    \\3. If both $M_1$ and $M_2$ accept the input, then accept.
    
    
    $M$ accepts $w$ if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ accept it. If either $M_1$ or $M_2$ rejects $w$, then $M$ rejects w. Since $M_!$ and $M_2$ are deciders, they will always halt. Consequently, $M$ will always halt, and is therefore a decider.
    
    \item complement:
    
    For any Turing-decidable language $L$, there is a Turing machine $M$ that decides it. To show that Turing-decidable languages are closed under complement, we construct a Turing machine $M'$ that decides $L'$, where
    $$L' = \{w \;|\;  w \in \overline{L} \text{ and $M$ decides $L$}  \}$$
    
    $M' = $ "On input $w$:
    \\1. Run $M$ on $w$. If it accepts, reject.
    \\2. If $M$ rejects, accept.
    
    
    If $M$ accepts $w$, $M'$ rejects it. If $M$ rejects $w$, $M'$ accepts it. Since $M$ is a decider, it will not loop. Therefore, $M'$ also will not loop and is a decider.
    \item set difference:
    
        Let $L$ be the set-difference between two Turing-decidable languages, $L_1$ and $L_2$. A language is decidable if and only if some non-deterministic Turing machine decides it(Corollary 3.19). Therefore it follows that for languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, there exist Turing machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ that decide them.

$L$ is Turing-decidable if and only if there is some non-deterministic Turing machine that decides it. Any non-deterministic Turing machine is automatically a deterministic Turing machine. So, to show that the Turing-decidable languages are closed under set-difference, we describe a Turing machine $M$ that decides $L$, where
$$L = \{w \;|\;  w \in L_1 \text{ and } w\notin L_2, M_1 \text{ and  $M_2$ decide $L_1$ and $L_2$}\}$$

$M = $ "On input string $w$: 
    \\Let $w$ be any string that contains symbols in languages $L_1$ and $L_2$. Then,
    \\1. Run $M_1$ on $w$. If it rejects, then reject.
    \\2. If $M_1$ accepts the input, run $M_2$ on $w$. If $M_2$ accepts, then reject.
    \\3. If $M_1$ accepts $w$ and $M_2$ rejects $w$, then accept.
    
    
$M$ accepts $w$ if $M_1$ accepts and $M_2$ rejects. If $M_1$ rejects $w$ or if $M_2$ accepts it, $M$ rejects. $M$ will always end up in either an accept or reject state, therefore it is a decider.

\end{enumerate} 

\paragraph{Problem 4}
Show that the Turing-recognizable languages are closed under concatenation

This problem requires providing constructions that take individual Turing machines and combines 
them into a new machine that {\em recognizes} the new language. Remember, this is about 
Turing-recognizable languages not just decidable so that there's a possibility of non-termination.

\paragraph{Problem 5} For each of the following Turing machine variants determine if the machine
is more powerful, equivalent, or less powerful than a single-tape Turing machine. If less powerful
describe the class of languages recognized by the machine. Explain your answers.
\begin{enumerate}[\indent a)]
    \item A Turing Machine that can only make moves to the right and never left.
    \item A Turing Machine that can move right one space or move left two spaces.
    \item A Turing Machine that never writes a space on the tape that already contains a symbol.
\end{enumerate}
